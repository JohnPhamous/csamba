        <span class="image left"><img src="/images/laser-processing.png"></span>Laser processing is being studied for the purpose of altering material structure, properties and performance for specific applications. Focused femtosecond lasers with comparatively
        low energy, (nanoJoule), high repetition rate, (megaHertz) pulses can be used to damage or remove small volumes of material. Steel, silicon, tungsten carbide and yttria-stabilized zirconia have been micro-machined using this regime of laser irradiation.
        High energy nanosecond laser pulses can create micro and nano scale surface structures on structural and bio metals like Magnesium and Titanium, changing properties like absorption, color, composition, hydrophobicity and roughness. Finally, continuous
        wave laser heating of novel nanocrystalline binary metal alloy powders for enhanced laser densification is an ongoing effort in hopes of achieving 3D-printed nanocrystalline alloys or composites that maintain their strength-increasing nano grain
        size in elevated temperature environments.

        <span class="image right"><img src="/images/laser-processing2.png"></span>I wrote that based of the short research bio I gave for Suveen's website recently: Kendrick researches the effect of laser irradiation on metal and ceramic structures and
        properties. His experience includes measuring low energy femtosecond laser ablation thresholds in yttria-stabilized zirconia, steel, silicon, and tungsten carbide. For changing surface properties like hydrophobicity, color, and roughness, high
        energy nanosecond laser pulses can create micro and nano scale surface structures on structural and bio metals like Magnesium and Titanium. Finally, continuous wave laser heating of novel nanocrystalline binary metal alloy powders for enhanced
        laser densification is an ongoing effort in hopes of achieving 3D-printed nanocrystalline alloys that maintain their grain size at elevated temperatures.
