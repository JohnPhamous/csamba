          <h3>Overview</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Stemming from multidisciplinary, international collaboration among material scientists, engineers, biologists, clinicians, and students from the University of California, Riverside and 3 top institutions in Mexico, the Center for the Synthesis of Advanced
          Materials for Biomedical Applications (C-SAMBA) seeks to synthesize, characterize, and test a new generation of nanocrystalline opto-ceramic materials for bioapplications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary application of these efforts is the development of a Window to the Brain (WttB) cranial implant, the transparency of which will allow for laser-based diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of brain pathologies, without repeated craniectomies.</p>

          <h3>About</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Officially formed in January 2016, the Center for the Synthesis of Advanced Materials for Biomedical Applications (C-SAMBA) grew out of a long-standing research collaboration between the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and 3 premier institutions
          in México: Centro de Investigación Científica y Educación Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) in Ensenada, Baja California; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) in México City; and Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE)
          in Puebla. Through the combination of UCR’s expertise in medical lasers, bio-transport phenomena, nanopowder synthesis, ceramic densification and processing, biocompatibility, and biomedical device development with expertise in optical characterization
          and laser processing (CICESE), fiber optic development (UNAM), and optical diagnostics (INAOE), C-SAMBA is well positioned to develop and synthesize a new generation of nanocrystalline opto-ceramic materials for biomedical applications, spanning
          from basic science through translational studies.</p>
