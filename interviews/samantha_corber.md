## Research areas

- titanium microneedle devices
- Rao: novel micro/nanofabrication methods

## Material Fabrication

- Implant in skull, need to grow skin over the material to protect body from alien materials. Instead of removing and replacing the skin everytime use OCA. They are biocompatible materials. Inject into skin to mimick same optical indexcies but lasers can go through them. OCA issues: if too large of a dosage will damage the body.

Creating microarrays to apply to a larger area in the skin.

"Fabricating hollow, out-of-plane, titatinum microneedle devices"

titannium is biocompatible material
high fracture toughness

is not brittle, can bend

lab works with microfabircation for titanium

ehtching tehcniques used in titainium similar to circuit boards

using out-of-plane needle is pretty hard, different etching is needed. Pushing the limti because no one else has done this. 

## Different than other projects

- Advance needle design, hollow compared to coating the drug. Active diffusion
- OCA delivery
- Make skin clear, make it accessible without the need to removing skin
- OCA has to be applied through injection
