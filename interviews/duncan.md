- Titainium foil bond to ceramic, diffusion bonding, press under high pressure and high heat
- Ittianum goes to melting point and it bonds
- Screws into titanium by screws
- Moving dentistry practices to cranial implants
- very little inflamation because the implant does not havea load like it does with hip implants

## Diffusion bonding
- bonding 2 different materials together
- capad: machine, Garay built it to make ysc pucks
    - current activatied pressure assisted densification of materials
    - vaccum chamber
    - put titanium and puck into it
    - creates vaccum and a plunger presses down and delivers current to heat up material

## Burst pressure testing
- test bond strength
- create a design for the titanium frame
- stress testing
- nanopatterning
